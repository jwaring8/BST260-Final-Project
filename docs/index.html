										<h2>Predicting Hospital Readmission</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital, gets re-admitted again within a certain period of time. The rates of hosptial readmission are now considered an indicator of hospital quality and also contributes to the high cost of healthcare in America. In order to adress this issue, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has established the <a href = "https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/acuteinpatientpps/readmissions-reduction-program.html">Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)</a> with the goal of improving the quality of care for patients and reducing healthcare spending. The primary way in which they do this apply bying payment penalties to hospitals that have more than expected readmission rates for certain conditions.  While diabetes has not yet been added to HRBP's list of conditions, Diabetes is the is the <a href = "https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb172-Conditions-Readmissions-Payer.jsp "> condition with the 3rd most all-cause, 30-day readmissions for Medicaid patients, and in 2011 American hospitals spent over $41 billion on diabetic patients who got readmitted within 30 days of discharge </a>. </p>
									<p>The ability to determine which risk factors lead to higher readmission in such patients, and accordingly being able to predict which patients will get readmitted, could help save hospitals billions of dollars while also improving thef quality of care. With this goal in mind, we set out to answer these two questions: </p>
									<ol>
										<li>How well can we predict 30 day hospital readmission of diabetes patients using medical claims data?</li>
										<li> What factors are the most important in predicting hosptial readmissions in a diabetic patient?</li>
									</ol>

									<h3>Dataset</h3>
									<p>The dataset we will be working with represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>It is an inpatient encounter (a hospital admission). </li>
										<li> It is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to the system as a diagnosis. </li>
										<li>The length of stay was at least 1 day and at most 14 days. </li>
							    	<li> Laboratory tests were perfocrmed during the encounter. </li>
 										<li> Medications were administered during the encounter. </li>
									</ol>
									<p> The data contains such attributes as patient number, race, gender, age, admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting physician, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test reslt, diagnosis, number of medication, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization, etc. This dataset is made publicly avaliable by the <a href = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008"> UCI Machine Learning Repository </a> </p>
									<p> Numerous steps were taken to clean the dataset, including the addition and removal of certain features. The final dataset features are described below: PUT TABLE 1 HERE!!!! </p>
